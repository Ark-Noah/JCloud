# JCloud

Apache jcloudsÂ® is an open-source multi-cloud toolkit for the Java platform that gives you the freedom to create applications that are portable across clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc) while giving you full control to use cloud-specific features. (https://jclouds.apache.org/ )

This project is a sample usage of the JCloud library to insert, update and delete a file in an AWS bucket.
